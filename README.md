**DeCleanup Rewards** is a decentralized application (dApp) build on Arbitrum and designed to:
a) **tokenize IRL impact created via global/local cleanup efforts**
b) **incentivize environmental actions via DeFi mechanics**. 
The platform promotes environmental stewardship globally, with plans to activate global/local communities and scale across multiple blockchain ecosystems.

## Uniqueness

**How DeCleanup dApp works**: Participants engage in cleanups, submit proof via photos, and earn dynamic NFTs that evolve based on their contributions. More details in our [Mirror Article](https://mirror.xyz/decleanupnet.eth/ZzncKRu-Q-leEZkQ48Txm-NQRxG_hH3V3wyHaYUKfYI).

**User-Centric Design & Functionality**: The DeCleanup dApp offers a seamless user experience with an intuitive interface, allowing individuals and communities to easily submit proof of cleanups and earn dynamic NFTs, reflecting real-world impact on-chain. The verification system ensures quick approval for rewards, making the process simple and efficient. 
More details in our [Guide](https://mirror.xyz/decleanupnet.eth/A5uzOpx9HUgXZEopCKUsbgffw9SajL4Q9eECgrguq-4).

**Gasless Approach**: We chose Arbitrum for its low gas fees, with only the first claim requiring gas payment, while the rest of the experience is gasless. This eliminates barriers to onboarding non-tech-savvy users into Web3, enhancing real-world impact - our key KPI. Gasless transactions make Web3 more accessible to everyday people.

**Contribution to Ecosystem Growth**: By integrating environmental action with blockchain technology, making it intuitive and practically gasless for the end user, DeCleanup boosts on-chain activity through introducing new wallets and increases community engagement.

**Innovation in Application**: DeCleanup tokenizes real-world impact, converting environmental efforts into on-chain assets, which can be recognized as valuable impact products in the broader blockchain ecosystem.

**Community Onchain Activation**: Gamification elements like leaderboards and challenges via [Guild XYZ](https://guild.xyz/decleanup-network) allow users to earn extra points and compete for top spots. High-ranking users make it to the whitelist, encouraging participation and collaboration within the network.

## dApp and Dynamic NFT Collection

![9 Levels NFTs](https://beige-defiant-spoonbill-537.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmZELVjF8H5VvG1BxhunXK4n6LuK17RBuis5yRepEqxARk)

The collection items have common traits that remain consistent with each NFT upgrade:
- **Category**: Cleanup Impact NFT
- **Type**: Dynamic
- **Impact**: Environmental

There are dynamic traits, which grow every three cleanups:
- **Rarity**: Common (1-3 cleanups), Rare (4-6 cleanups), Legendary (7-9 cleanups), Unique (10 cleanups)
- **Level**: Newbie (1-3 cleanups), Pro (4-6 cleanups), Hero (7-9 cleanups), Guardian (10 cleanups)

And dynamic traits which grow with every cleanup done:
- **Impact Value**: 1 (first cleanup) to 10 (last cleanup)
- **DCU Points**: 10 (first cleanup) to 100 (last cleanup)

While the first two categories of traits determine the general information required for this impact product’s classification on the Impact Marketplace, the last categories are mainly dynamic traits, which will determine the rewards value via Impact Marketplace DeFi utility and will contribute for user’s IRL impact rank.

## Partnerships and Community Activation

Initial community outreach was established by partnership proposals with the key networks such as GreenPill Network and ReFi DAO. [ReFi](https://x.com/refiphangan/status/1837797388368728419?s=61)
and GreenPill Phangan, in particular are active in the [Monthly Earth Day](https://x.com/highlyartistic/status/1837668300425429023?s=61) movement. The other ReFi node that is organizing cleanups is [ReFi Tulum](https://x.com/refitulum/status/1838290711961112606?s=61)
Additional partnerships with [Aqua Purge web3](https://x.com/aquapurgeweb3/status/1822565379593449715?s=61) have furthered our global reach. These communities organize regular cleanups and were the first we have targeted.
Recent community that joined the Network, [HEMJapan](https://x.com/hemjapan?s=21), impressed us with 12 new wallets applied with the proofs after their recent Monthly Earth Day [cleanup](https://x.com/hemjapan/status/1838096871035928649?s=61).
Moreover, we are establishing partnerships with like minded projects. As example, DeCleanup and [Cleanify](https://x.com/cleanify_vet?s=21) have a collaborative strategy to promote each other, motivating both communities to organize more cleanups, and providing additional incentives for them.
